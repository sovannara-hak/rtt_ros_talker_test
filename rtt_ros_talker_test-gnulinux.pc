# Rationale:
# - The prefix is equal to the package directory.
# - The libdir is where the libraries were built, ie, package/lib
# - The include dir in cflags allows top-level headers and in package/include/package/header.h
# - If this doesn't fit your package layout, don't use orocos_generate_package() and write the .pc file yourself
